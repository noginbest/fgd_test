Nespresso pods or Starbucks brewed,7 cups,sleep deprivation; lack of energy; schoolwork and schedule,convenient; tastes fine; pods,"Yes, it is a product steadily used in my household.","I am somewhat aware, as I remember the initiative Nespresso had in collecting the pods and bringing it back to the store, yet my family did not sustain this practice because when we did bring it back to the store, not much happened. It became inconvenient for us, so sadly we did not commit to that effort. I think the brand is doing its effort to become their desired reputation Yet,. I think their context and effort is not as successful in the Philippines, due to the premium of the brand and it is inaccessibility to the masses.","I think depending on the overall demographic of those who answered your survey, if it was mostly youth and college students environmental awareness is a big factor we wish to consider and promote due to the knowledge of the ecological struggles and climate change that are present and most effective to our generations. Knowing that a company is environmentally aware, makes us want to support and become interested in the brand. (which results in higher chance of purchase/ consumption)","Environmental advertisement is important, yet I believe that there should be actual proof and real practice of what is shown in the advertisement. It is very easy nowadays to fake details in advertisement to cater to generation that is growing to care more about environment than their own pleasure with consumption.","The use of ecobranding is also interesting to audiences, when it is present in a brand, I am drawn to it because I do want to help my environment. WIth that being said, similar last point, I hope this eco branding is consistent and real. I think this has a greater average than environmental advertisement because branding requires more of the identity of the brand in actuality versus an add that can take diverse approaches. Since the branding promotes the identity of the brand, the use of eco draws in more as they wish to help the environment recover.","Similar to eco-branding I think the use of eco-labeling shows transparency to the consumer as to how committed the company is to the environment. Since it does not deal with the product consumed itself, I think this is necessary but not essential to the good of coffee or Nespresso coffee. This is why its average is on lower scale of 4.4.","Eco-packaging is important because it is the direct vessel of which the product of a brand is carried and distributed. With the goods being packaged in eco-friendly material, consumers are able to safely consume more without the guilt of packaging polluting and affecting the environment. This detail is more crucial compared to others because it deals with how goods are disposed of after consumption and how these materias could end up polluting or not being disposed properly.","I agree that all factors of environmental awareness, environmental advertisement, eco-branding, eco-labelling and eco-packaging when used by Nespresso increases the likelihood to purchase and even patronize these goods. Besides the fact that this company does provide quality product, these practices promote the advocacy of environmental concern (one that I prioritize) and thus such, does increase my interest to purchase Nespresso goods. Because the brand is aware of issues that I am also responsive to, I am able to support the brand wholly. Yet, I think besides these factors, cost, premium good and market price are factors that still hinder the popularity of the brand in the Philippines."
Nespresso,14 cups,horrible sleep schedule; takes coffee after every class,the best,yes everyday,"i drink nespresso like nespresso, they do a good job on its sustainability, their whole thing is to reduce their carbon footprint, there’s like a whole poster, will buy it regardless of that, they care about the environment","YES - I can see the incentive on it, they see the green option when they have the choice to; it can opt him to buy","Regardless of advertisement, he’d purchase. He hasn’t read ads but he’ll be more inclined to buy it. Their eco-friendly initiatives will be more helpful but again he’d buy it either way.","i think if u consume smth thats eco-friendly, you would be more inclined to purchase it, its also smth thats helpful to the environment, the reason why people use eco-friendly products more","Wouldn't purchase just because of its eco-labeling. It comes for personal preferences. If it’s something he uses already, he’d purchase it more. He doesn’t think that people would go out of their way just because of their labeling.","the packaging is the first thing you see, so having a good packaging would influence people especially if it’s something they already consumer",Eco-labeling wont affect his purchase behavior. The eco-friendliness would just make him more inclined to purchase becuase it’s already a product that he consumes. The eco-friendliness is only something that could push him to purchase.
Starbucks,4 cups,staying up all night for school,cheap (for its quality),no,"i do believe in its sustainability efforts because i think they use eco-frineldy materials in producing their coffee and liek whats presented in the screen, they do not use plastic when placing their like uh coffee in those types of packaging",YES -prioritizing the env is important; para di makasama sa environment,AGREE - there is a need for advertisements for the awareness of their customers. It makes him want to purchase the product more and inform other people about their eco-friendly products.,i agree - eco branding does influence my purchase behjavior because knowing that the company uses eco friendly materials means they’re promoting it; they make sure that the company will not use materials that will harm the environment; it assures us that these companies would use harmful materials to the environment,"Agree - before purchasing, he checks if there’s eco labeling so that he can be sure that the product uses eco-friendly materials. Before consuming, he’d be assured that it’s recyclable.",i agree that eco-packaging affects my purchase behavior; same answer; i think its every important the companies’ products are recyclable,Agree - All of those tools are important because there are climate issues that are currently happening. It’s important to integrate eco-friendliness in the products and operations
Starbucks,7 cups,adds to productivity; schoolwork; always invites for coffee whenever she goes out with other people,Unique,I only tried it once.,Not that much since I rarely consume Nespresso products.,I do agree that brands showing environmental awareness greatly captures the interest of the consumers.,I do believe that advertising a product in an environmental-friendly way captures the interest of the consumers as it helps improve credibility and helps the brand to stand out among its competitors.,"Learning that Nespresso exhibits eco-branding, this marketing approach will surely influences the likeliness of the consumers to purchase since it shows that the brand doesn’t do any harm to the environment.",I agree to this since I find myself interested to products that shows a green-label suggesting that it is ‘eco-friendly.’,"I do agree that having an eco-friendly packaging greatly favors the consumer preferences in choosing what brand they would go for. Thus, Nespresso having an eco-packaging surely won’t let the consumers feel any guilt in consuming their products.","As a person that clings in finding ways in saving the environment, seeing a brand that shares the same sentiments and shows care for the environment greatly captures my interest to use its products."
Dunkin Donuts,5 cups,it’s a part of his daily routine of consuming coffee,fancy/luxurious,no,"haven’t heard of their sustainability efforts at all, so its kinda unknown to most haha","YES - we can observe it through time, lets say in a market, instead of uysing plastic bags you’re now using eco friendly bags, from styrofoams we are now using bags, yes it influences the purchase behavior of customers for the target market","an effective and strong env adv from companies would really help in persuading buyers are especially buyers are more aware about the environmental iussues that are happening thru time; the more u adverftise a specific problem over time, they will want to support that company more and share it to their friends about the product; it gives more attention to the product and not to the csr of the company",it would help the company to market the products to coffee consumers. It would assure the consumers that the company would help the environment.,"based on t he results, its average. Huh smth effective, its not about the labelling, its about how they use, made, the process is done. Eco-labelling is the first step in introducing their product in a new picture",It influences. How we perceive our coffee is more effective to attract more customers.,"Agree - its all about the consistency to transparency with these kinds of factors, it will affect how the buyers will perceive the product in a new way or picture as an eco-friendly company/product"
Nescafe or Starbucks,7 cups,"Weather and my mood. The weather in a way because if it is cold, I prefer hot chocolate more but if the weather is hot, I would drink my coffee (iced). Then my mood also affects my coffee consumption because if I am feeling sleepy or lazy but there are things that I have to finish, I usually drink coffee.",Expensive,Not yet because I have always perceived the product as somewhat expensive and for me it is not necessary for my own habit of coffee consumption because im just a regular drinker and not a big coffee enthusiast.,"I am aware of Nespresso’s environmental sustainability for its capsule recycling business model. But for me, I think the brand, in terms of it being sustainable is kind of overrated because I think there were some issues before about Nespresso being wasteful in the coffee grounds being used and the amount of energy it needs for it to produce high quality coffee.","I agree with the results because I think our generation (considering also the people who answered the survey) are more politically and socially aware because of social media giving light to important social causes that need attention. With the proper knowledge and information on these things, I think people like me would try our best to incorporate interests or habits to being socially responsible with our consumptions.","Yeah, I agree with this one because people will need information on particular cause related marketing campaigns to determine whether it is relevant enough for them to support the cause or not. This approach in advertisement also aids that “consumer skepticism” that consumers usually have in purchasing products that support a cause.","Yeah, I agree since if the company is indeed trying to make a cause related product, it must be direct on its message on what it is that its trying to support. For me, I think an effective eco branding is when it is relatable for the consumers and something that they themselves have observed from their own surroundings.","Yes I agree because for me, when I see an eco label, it says that this sustainable practice is well known globally and its initiative is huge enough to be certified and recognized around the world.",Yes I agree here because I think the packaging itself says a lot about the campaign and the company itself. It will be a huge turn off if the product being sold supports a sustainable cause and yet the packaging is using plastic. So yea I think the packaging has a huge bearing for my own purchase decision.,"Yea I agree with these influences for our purchase behavior because after considering all these information, me as a consumer can now decide on whether it is worthwhile for us to support the product or not. For me, it is hard to decide on whether to support a cause related product because I am quite stingy and base my purchase decisions on my own experience. But if the information provided are complete enough and it goes with my habit of consumption, then I will most likely buy it."
Kopiko and or Nescafe,7 cups,"I think factors that affect my coffee consumption are my daily activities, cost and its availability.",Fancy.,"No, because my parents are the one who’s buying our needs and there’s no Nespresso products available.","Honestly, no. But upon searching it on the internet, it really has a reputation as the world’s most sustainable coffee company.","I think that I can agree with it because most people, especially the younger generation, like to buy and support products that don't only focus on the income but also with environmental awareness.",,I think that I can agree with it because most people buy and support brands knowing that they can also help/contribute to the environment just by purchasing its products.,I think that I can agree with it because most people will most likely buy products if they know and proven that the product is really environmentally friendly. I think that this also adds to the credibility and authenticity of the product.,I think that I can agree with it because a lot of people buy products especially if the packaging is good/nice and or eco-friendly.,I think that I can agree that a lot of people take these things into consideration because they want to make sure that the product they are buying is really worth it will not be disappointed.
Angkan,7 cups,It's a must for me to have a cup at least a day.,Quick espresso maker,Yes,Not thoroughly aware,It is important that shoppers and consumers are made aware of a company's contribution to reduce carbon footprint,Mental availability is crucial tool to influence shoppers and consumers.,A compan/brand's image towards the public further supports and assist the brand in strengthening credibility,Having all info on the lable further promotes a company's credibility,"Among all marketing tool, this is the most important as this is where the company/brand can prove its commitments to lessen carbon footprint","For a company to be known, reach its goal and create an impact, its effort has to be in 360 deg."
